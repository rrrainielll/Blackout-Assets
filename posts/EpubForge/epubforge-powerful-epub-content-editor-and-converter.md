## Behind This Website

This website is built from my own ideas and brought to life with the help of AI.

I created this app because I wanted to read my own books, but I ran into an issue—**Google Play Books wouldn’t process the EPUB files** I was uploading. Instead of giving up, I decided to build a solution.

That’s how **EpubForge** was created. The app helps validate and fix EPUB files so they work properly with Google Play Books and other ebook readers. To make it more useful, I also added file conversion support.

### Supported Formats
- **EPUB** (fixed and optimized)
- **PDF Document**
- **Plain Text (.txt)**
- **MOBI (Legacy)**
- **PDB (PalmDOC)**

EpubForge is a practical tool built from a real problem, and I continue to improve it as I learn, experiment, and build more ideas into reality.
